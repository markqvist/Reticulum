# This RNS example demonstrates how to set up a link to  #

# using a channel.                                       #

#### Shared Objects ######################################
##########################################################

# Channel data must be structured in a subclass of
# MessageBase. This ensures that the channel will be able
# to serialize and deserialize the object and multiplex it
# with other objects. Both ends of a link will need the
# same object definitions to be able to communicate over
# a channel.
#
# Note: The objects we wish to use over the channel must
# be registered with the channel, and each link has a
# different channel instance. See the client_connected
# and link_established functions in this example to see
# how message types are registered.

# Let's make a simple message class called StringMessage
# that will convey a string with a timestamp.

class StringMessage(RNS.MessageBase):
    # The MSGTYPE class variable needs to be assigned a
    # 2 byte integer value. This identifier allows the
    # channel to look up your message's constructor when a
    # message arrives over the channel.
    #
    # MSGTYPE must be unique across all message types we
    # register with the channel. MSGTYPEs >= 0xf000 are
    # reserved for the system.
    MSGTYPE = 0x0101

    # The constructor of our object must be callable with
    # no arguments. We can have parameters, but they must
    # have a default assignment.
    #
    # This is needed so the channel can create an empty
    # version of our message into which the incoming
    # message can be unpacked.
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()

    # Finally, our message needs to implement functions
    # the channel can call to pack and unpack our message
    # to/from the raw packet payload. We'll use the
    # umsgpack package bundled with RNS. We could also use
    # the struct package bundled with Python if we wanted
    # more control over the structure of the packed bytes.
    #
    # Also note that packed message objects must fit
    # entirely in one packet. The number of bytes
    # available for message payloads can be queried from
    # the channel using the Channel.MDU property. The
    # channel MDU is slightly less than the link MDU due
    # to encoding the message header.

    # The pack function encodes the message contents into
    # a byte stream.
    def pack(self) -> bytes:
        return umsgpack.packb((self.data, self.timestamp))

    # And the unpack function decodes a byte stream into
    # the message contents.
    def unpack(self, raw):
        self.data, self.timestamp = umsgpack.unpackb(raw)
