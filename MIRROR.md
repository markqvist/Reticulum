This repository is a public mirror. All potential future development is happening elsewhere.

I am stepping back from all public-facing interaction with this project. Reticulum has always been primarily my work, and continuing in the current public, internet-facing model is no longer sustainable.

The software remains available for use as-is. Occasional updates may appear at unpredictable intervals, but there will be no support, no responses to issues, no discussions, and no community management in this or any other public venue. If it doesn't work for you, it doesn't work. That is the entire extent of available troubleshooting assistance I can offer you.

If you've followed this project for a while, you already know what this means. You know who designed, wrote and tested this, and you know how many years of my life it took. You'll also know about both my particular challenges and strengths, and how I believe anything worth building needs to be built and  maintained with our own hands.

Seven months ago, I said I needed to step back, that I was exhausted, and that I needed to recover. I believed a public resolve would be enough to effectuate that, but while striving to get just a few more useful features and protocols out, the unproductive requests and demands also ramped up, and I got pulled back into the same patterns and draining interactions that I'd explicitly said I couldn't sustain anymore.

So here's what you might have already guessed: I'm done playing the game by rules I can't win at.

Everything you need is right here, and by any sensible measure, it's done. Anyone who wants to invest the time, skill and persistence can build on it, or completely re-imagine it with different priorities. That was always the point.

The people who actually contributed - you know who you are, and you know I mean it when I say: Thank you. All of you who've used this to build something real - that was the goal, and you did it without needing me to hold your hand.

The rest of you: You have what you need. Use it or don't. I am not going to be the person who explains it to you anymore.

This is not a temporary break. It's not "see you after some rest", but a recognition that the current model is fundamentally incompatible with my life, my health, and my reality.

If you want to support continued work, you can do so at the donation links listed in this repository. But please understand, that this is not purchasing support or guaranteeing updates. It is support for work that happens on my timeline, according to my capacity, which at the moment is not what it was.

If you want Reticulum to continue evolving, you have the power to make that happen. The protocol is public domain. The code is open source. Everything you need is right here. I've provided the tools, but building what comes next is not my responsibility anymore. It's yours.

To the small group of people who has actually been here, and understood what this work was and what it cost - you already know where to find me if it actually matters.

To everyone else: This is where we part ways. No hard feelings. It's just time.
