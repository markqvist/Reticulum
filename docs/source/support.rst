Provide Feedback
================
Feedback on the usage, functioning and potential dysfunctioning of any and
all components of the system is very valuable to the continued development and
improvement of Reticulum. But...

.. warning::
  
  **Think before you speak**. As time has shown, over 80% of the "feedback",
  "bug reports" and "advice" the Reticulum project has received has been
  irrelevant noise, stemming from erroneous assumptions, misunderstanding the
  foundational functionality or philosophy behind the system, or simply
  the malinformed (but overly opinionated) personal preferences of individual
  drive-by architects. This wastes the time of everyone involved.

  The Reticulum project is not a public teahouse for serving the attention
  needs of random bypassers, but a highly complex system engineered and
  refined over more than a decade, designed to provide communication and
  connectivity guarantees in highly adversarial environments.

  If you want to voice your opinion, it better be well-informed, and we
  expect you to have a comprehensive and solid foundation for your points
  of view. Everything else will be ignored.

Absolutely no automated analytics, telemetry, error
reporting or statistics is collected and reported by Reticulum under any
circumstances, so we rely on old-fashioned human feedback.
