<h1>Getting Started Fast<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started-fast" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The best way to get started with the Reticulum Network Stack depends on what
you want to do. This guide will outline sensible starting paths for different
scenarios.</p>
<div class="section" id="try-using-a-reticulum-based-program">
<h2>Try Using a Reticulum-based Program<a class="headerlink" href="#try-using-a-reticulum-based-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you simply want to try using a program built with Reticulum, a few different
programs exist that allow basic communication and a range of other useful functions
over even extremely low-bandwidth Reticulum networks.</p>
<p>These programs will let you get a feel for how Reticulum works. They have been designed
to run well over networks based on LoRa or packet radio, but can also be used completely
over local WiFi, wired ethernet, the Internet, or any combination.</p>
<p>As such, it is easy to get started experimenting, without having to set up any radio
transceivers or infrastructure just to try it out. Launching the programs on separate
devices connected to the same WiFi network is enough to get started, and physical
radio interfaces can then be added later.</p>
<div class="section" id="nomad-network">
<h3>Nomad Network<a class="headerlink" href="#nomad-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The terminal-based program <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/markqvist/nomadnet">Nomad Network</a>
provides a complete encrypted communications suite built with Reticulum. It features
encrypted messaging (both direct and delayed-delivery for offline users), file sharing,
and has a built-in text-browser and page server with support for dynamically rendered pages,
user authentication and more.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/nomadnet_3.png"><img alt="_images/nomadnet_3.png" src="_images/nomadnet_3.png" /></a>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/markqvist/nomadnet">Nomad Network</a> is a user-facing client
for the messaging and information-sharing protocol
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/markqvist/lxmf">LXMF</a>, another project built with Reticulum.</p>
<p>You can install Nomad Network via pip:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Install ...</span>
<span class="n">pip3</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">nomadnet</span>

<span class="c1"># ... and run</span>
<span class="n">nomadnet</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Please Note</strong>: If this is the very first time you use pip to install a program
on your system, you might need to reboot your system for your program to become
available. If you get a “command not found” error or similar when running the
program, reboot your system and try again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sideband">
<h3>Sideband<a class="headerlink" href="#sideband" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you would rather use a program with a graphical user interface, you can take
a look at <a class="reference external" href="https://unsigned.io/sideband">Sideband</a>, which is available for Android,
Linux and macOS.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_images/sideband_1.png"><img alt="_images/sideband_1.png" class="align-center" src="_images/sideband_1.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p>Sideband is currently in the early stages of development, but already provides basic
communication features, and interoperates with Nomad Network, or any other LXMF client.</p>

<div class="section" id="using-the-included-utilities">
<h2>Using the Included Utilities<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-included-utilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reticulum comes with a range of included utilities that make it easier to
manage your network, check connectivity and make Reticulum available to other
programs on your system.</p>
<p>You can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rnsd</span></code> to run Reticulum as a background or foreground service,
and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rnstatus</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rnpath</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rnprobe</span></code> utilities to view and query
network status and connectivity.</p>
<p>To learn more about these utility programs, have a look at the
<a class="reference internal" href="using.html#using-main"><span class="std std-ref">Using Reticulum on Your System</span></a> chapter of this manual.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-network-with-reticulum">
<h2>Creating a Network With Reticulum<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-network-with-reticulum" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To create a network, you will need to specify one or more <em>interfaces</em> for
Reticulum to use. This is done in the Reticulum configuration file, which by
default is located at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.reticulum/config</span></code>. You can edit this file by hand,
or use the interactive <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rnsconfig</span></code> utility.</p>
<p>When Reticulum is started for the first time, it will create a default
configuration file, with one active interface. This default interface uses
your existing ethernet and WiFi networks (if any), and only allows you to
communicate with other Reticulum peers within your local broadcast domains.</p>
<p>To communicate further, you will have to add one or more interfaces. The default
configuration includes a number of examples, ranging from using TCP over the
internet, to LoRa and Packet Radio interfaces.</p>
<p>With Reticulum, you only need to configure what interfaces you want to communicate
over. There is no need to configure address spaces, subnets, routing tables,
or other things you might be used to from other network types.</p>
<p>Once Reticulums knows which interfaces it should use, it will automatically
discover topography and configure transport of data to any destinations it
knows about.</p>
<p>In situations where you already have an established WiFi or ethernet network, and
many devices that want to utilise the same external Reticulum network (for example over
LoRa), it will often be sufficient to let one system act as a Reticulum gateway, by
adding any external interfaces to this systems configuration, and enabling transport. Any
other device on your local WiFi will then be able to connect to this wider Reticulum
network just using the default interface configuration.</p>
<p>Possibly, the examples in the config file are enough to get you started. If
you want more information, you can read the <a class="reference internal" href="networks.html#networks-main"><span class="std std-ref">Building Networks</span></a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="interfaces.html#interfaces-main"><span class="std std-ref">Interfaces</span></a> chapters of this manual.</p>

<div class="section" id="connecting-reticulum-instances-over-the-internet">
<h2>Connecting Reticulum Instances Over the Internet<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-reticulum-instances-over-the-internet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reticulum currently offers two interfaces suitable for connecting instances over the Internet: <a class="reference internal" href="interfaces.html#interfaces-tcps"><span class="std std-ref">TCP</span></a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="interfaces.html#interfaces-i2p"><span class="std std-ref">I2P</span></a>. Each interface offers a different set of features, and Reticulum
users should carefully choose the interface which best suites their needs.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TCPServerInterface</span></code> allows users to host an instance accessible over TCP/IP. This
method is generally faster, lower latency, and more energy efficient than using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">I2PInterface</span></code>,
however it also leaks more data about the server host.</p>
<p>TCP connections reveal the IP address of both your instance and the server to anyone who can
inspect the connection. Someone could use this information to determine your location or identity. Adversaries
inspecting your packets may be able to record packet metadata like time of transmission and packet size.
Even though Reticulum encrypts traffic, TCP does not, so an adversary may be able to use
packet inspection to learn that a system is running Reticulum, and what other IP adresses connect to it.
Hosting a publicly reachable instance over TCP also requires a publicly reachable IP address,
which most Internet connections don’t offer anymore.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">I2PInterface</span></code> routes messages through the <a class="reference external" href="https://geti2p.net/en/">Invisible Internet Protocol
(I2P)</a>. To properly use this interface, users must also run an I2P daemon in
parallel to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rnsd</span></code>. For always-on I2P nodes it is recommended to use <a class="reference external" href="https://i2pd.website/">i2pd</a>.</p>
<p>By default, I2P will encrypt and mix all traffic sent over the Internet, and
hide both the sender and receiver Reticulum instance IP addresses. Running an I2P node
will also relay other I2P user’s encrypted packets, which will use extra
bandwidth and compute power, but also makes timing attacks and other forms of
deep-packet-inspection much more difficult.</p>
<p>I2P also allows users to host globally available Reticulum instances from non-public IPs and behind firewalls.</p>
<p>In general it is recommended to use an I2P node if you want to host a publically accessible
instance, while preserving anonymity. If you care more about performance, and a slightly
easier setup, use TCP.</p>

<div class="section" id="connect-to-the-public-testnet">
<h2>Connect to the Public Testnet<a class="headerlink" href="#connect-to-the-public-testnet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An experimental public testnet has been made accessible over both I2P and TCP. You can join it
by adding one of the following interfaces to your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.reticulum/config</span></code> file:</p>

<p>Many other Reticulum instances are connecting to this testnet, and you can also join it
via other entry points if you know them. There is absolutely no control over the network
topography, usage or what types of instances connect. It will also occasionally be used
to test various failure scenarios, and there are no availability or service guarantees.</p>

<p>Reticulum can be used on Android in different ways. The easiest way to get
started is using an app like <a class="reference external" href="https://unsigned.io/sideband">Sideband</a>.</p>
<p>For more control and features, you can use Reticulum and related programs via
the <a class="reference external" href="https://termux.com/">Termux app</a>, at the time of writing available on
<a class="reference external" href="https://f-droid.org">F-droid</a>.</p>
<p>Termux is a terminal emulator and Linux environment for Android based devices,
which includes the ability to use many different programs and libraries,
including Reticulum.</p>
<p>Since the Python cryptography.io module does not offer pre-built wheels for
Android, the standard one-line install of Reticulum does not work on Android,
and a few extra commands are required.</p>
<p>From within Termux, execute the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># First, make sure indexes and packages are up to date.</span>
<span class="n">pkg</span> <span class="n">update</span>
