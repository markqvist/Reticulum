 - Fixed an issue where local UDP broadcast echoes could get processed as inbound packets.

### 2021-05-20: RNS β 0.2.1

This beta release sees significant improvements to bandwidth utilization and efficiency, while improving security by dropping RSA and moving completely to Curve25519.

- All asymmetric cryptography migrated to X25519/Ed25519. This has greatly improved efficiency and reduced protocol overhead significantly.
- Work has continued on the documentation, and the "Understanding Reticulum" chapters have been improved significantly in this release.
- Class methods dealing with setting callbacks have been renamed to be more intuitive.

As a few examples of the improved efficiency, a complete link establishment now only costs 240 bytes, down from 409 in the previous RSA version. An announce takes up 151 bytes vs 323.

### 2021-05-18: RNS β 0.2.0

This is the first beta release of RNS. This release also marks the publication of the Reticulum documentation, manual, and API documentation. All core features of Reticulum are now implemented, functional and ready to use in external programs. The wire-format and API will only change if there is a very good reason, though internals are still likely to be altered and optimised, and features are likely to be added.
