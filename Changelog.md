```

### 2024-09-09: RNS β 0.7.7

This release adds support for automatic encryption key ratcheting for all packets, not just those sent over Reticulum links. In practical terms, this adds forward secrecy to packets sent with the raw `Packet` API.

In this release, the ratchets feature must be enabled on a per-destination basis by calling the `enable_ratchets` method on the relevant destination. In a future release, ratchets may become the default option, but for backwards-compatibility, it is currently optional. For more information, read the API documentation.

**Please note!** Versions of RNS prior to `0.7.7` will not be able to pass announces for destinations with ratchets enabled! If you use applications that can use ratchets (for example, LXMF version `0.5.0` and up), it is important that you update all transport instances on your network to `0.7.7`.

Thanks to @deavmi, @faragher, @jacobeva, @jeremy and @jeremybox for contributing to this release!

**Changes**
- Added key ratchet rotation and signalling
- Added ratchet API to documentation
- Added initial support for flashing T-Echo devices to `rnodeconf`
- Added remote management config options to example config
- Added automtic integration tests to source repository
- Fixed a regression that caused RNS not to work on Python versions lower than 3.10
- Fixed missing `establishment_rate` property init on Link objects

**Release Hashes**

 - Link initiators can now identify to the remote peer over the link, once it has been set up. This can be used for authentication, amongst other things.
 - Requests and responses of arbitrary sizes can now be carried out over links.
 - UDP and TCP interfaces can now be bound to network device names (eth0, wlan0, etc.) instead of manually specifying listen IPs.

**Fixed bugs**
 - Fixed a race condition in outbound transport packet filtering.
 - Fixed an issue where local UDP broadcast echoes could get processed as inbound packets.

### 2021-05-20: RNS β 0.2.1

This beta release sees significant improvements to bandwidth utilization and efficiency, while improving security by dropping RSA and moving completely to Curve25519.

- All asymmetric cryptography migrated to X25519/Ed25519. This has greatly improved efficiency and reduced protocol overhead significantly.
- Work has continued on the documentation, and the "Understanding Reticulum" chapters have been improved significantly in this release.
- Class methods dealing with setting callbacks have been renamed to be more intuitive.

As a few examples of the improved efficiency, a complete link establishment now only costs 240 bytes, down from 409 in the previous RSA version. An announce takes up 151 bytes vs 323.

### 2021-05-18: RNS β 0.2.0

This is the first beta release of RNS. This release also marks the publication of the Reticulum documentation, manual, and API documentation. All core features of Reticulum are now implemented, functional and ready to use in external programs. The wire-format and API will only change if there is a very good reason, though internals are still likely to be altered and optimised, and features are likely to be added.
